## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   Typescript
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - build tool
-   [React hook form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - library for handling forms in React

### What I learned

I used this project to get back into writing code after a long break. It did not pose much of a challenge. I was already familiar with most of what I should know to build it.

To avoid writing a custom solution for form validation, I used a library called React hook form. While it wasn't necessary for such a simple task, knowing how to use it can come in handy later.

### Continued development

I attempted make the color of the buttons transition smoothly to gradient on hover but could not make it work. However, while working on it, I learned about CSS Houdini and some of the more advanced ways to use CSS custom properties. As to why it did not work, I am sure the reason is the outdated version of Google Chrome I had to use for testing. Also these features aren't supported in some browsers yet so I don't think I will use them any time soon.
